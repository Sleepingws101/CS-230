For an assignment by SNHU

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client had developed a game called "Draw It or Lose It" which was only available as an Andriod app. They were looking to expand the application's user access by making it available as a web-based game, available on multiple platforms.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

To me, the primary purpose of this document was to illustrate for the Client the various developmental requirements for the application to work as a web-based game. Additionally, we were asked to give our own recommendations for various application requirements. I believe what I did best was outlining what the requirements were for each operating platform and the benefits of each. Primarily when giving the server and client side of things, I didn't fully understand what was needed for the development tools but I blame that mostly on poor instructions. If something specific is expected within a component of an assignment, it should be clearly stated. That aside, I still believe the development requirements was what I did best. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I did like that the assignment had a predesigned template. It made it much easier to fill out and felt more structed than most SNHU assignments, which I find lack both content and instructions. However, one draw back again, the fact that if something specific is expected, it should be stated to the student with understanding that we are STUDENTS and are still learning with very limited access to resources outside of a textbook. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the developer tools requirement portion. I did do a lot of research for each section but found that the instructions for the assignment were very limited. There were things expected of us that weren't clearly outlined. Given the feedback from this assignment, I would keep in mind what is actually expected rather than what is stated for the assignment, since there is a clear difference. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

It is easy to take the user's needs and determine various requirements, what I found to be difficult was finding a way to articulate it in the way SNHU, or perhaps the instructor, wanted. It is easy to do the assignments themselves. What I found to be most difficult was incorporating was learned throughout the course and applying it directly into this assignment since it felt unnecessary to outlines such things to the client. I focused a lot on the perspective of the client, rather than the perspective of the grader. This is something I learned in various English classes, to speak in plain english as if the reader is clueless, I found it difficult to apply those teaching while doing this assignment, since they contradict each other. It is important to consider the user's needs, and future needs, because that those needs are what the application is being build around. Future needs, in my opinion, are almost equally as important, since they will likely be required at some point down the line.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I have to admit, my technique for this application could have used some work. While I did my best to do everything as instructed, I found that I was constantly getting knocked for the technique I used. Even now, I don't fully comprehend the technique covered for this assignment. I've always focused more on content over the actual technique I use, I'm hoping this is due to inexperience and that I will learn more effective coding techniques in the future. I will try to learn various techniques and apply whatever makes the most sense for whatever particular application I'm working on.
